# What does this project do?

As many Koreans go out less due to COVID-19, the demand for delivery food has increased. As a result, they were forced to eat less vegetables and fruits and eat more meat-based foods. Eventually, the nutrients in our body become out of balance, which leads to an imbalance of nutrients in our body. If the nutritional imbalance in our body continues, we can get anemia, reduced immunity, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and many other diseases. 

To solve this problem, I would like to introduce a program called Nubalancer to balance our nutrients.

# Why is this project useful?

Many people remember the food they ate, but not the nutrients they ate throughout the day. Therefore, we eat food without considering the nutrients of the food, and if it continues, the nutrient balance of our body will be broken. 

Nutrient imbalance in our body is a very serious problem because it can lead to various diseases such as anemia, obesity, weakened immunity, high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, and heart disease.

However, if you use the Nubalancer program, you can calculate the total amount of each nutrient consumed by entering keywords for the names of the foods you ate during the day. In addition, it can help balance the nutrients in our body by telling you how much or how much the nutrients you consume are insufficient or excessive than the daily nutrient intake standards specified by the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

If you try to balance the nutrients in our body through the Nubalancer program, you will be able to prevent various diseases.
